Venom Language
==============
Venom is a statically-typed scripting language. The vision is to combine the
ease of use of languages like Python and Ruby, with the strong compiler
guarantees and performance of a language like Java.

This is currently an active work in progress. Everything is very experimental,
and nothing really works yet ;). Check back soon though, we hope to have a
proof of concept implementation soon, followed by an alpha release.
